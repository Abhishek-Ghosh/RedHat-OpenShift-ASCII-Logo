## How to USE on this OpenShift Logo for Projects :question:

Long story. There is a `.sh` file and a plain text of the ASCII Art. Use as you need.

### How to use this OpenShift Logo on localhost as Shell Script :question:

That can written here! There is a `openshift.sh` script. Do a curl or wget or `git clone` this project (good idea) or manually copy and paste as `.sh` file. Run these :

````
git clone https://github.com/AbhishekGhosh/RedHat-OpenShift-ASCII-Logo.git
cd Red*
chmod +x openshift.sh
./openshift.sh
